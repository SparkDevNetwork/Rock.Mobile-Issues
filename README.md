# Rock.Mobile Issue Tracker

For a successful issue submission please read this entire readme. We care about the quality of Rock Mobile, but with our limited resources we can only take complete and detailed issue submissions. Please understand that we are not trying to be difficult, but rather protecting our very limited resources.

Rock Mobile is a complex collection of 3rd party frameworks as well as some custom elements. As such, we can only support issues with the Rock Mobile Shell directly. If your bug report is not actually a Rock Mobile Shell we will close the issue and direct you to the proper place.

We are also very limited on the resources we have to investigate bug reports. What this means is that you _must_ provide exact and detailed steps to reproduce your problem. If we look at the issue and there is not enough details for us to replicate the problem then we will close the issue.

Feature requests should be made at https://community.rockrms.com/Ideas with the Domain set to Apple TV.

Examples of things we are unable to help with:
* Issues that only manifest on your custom-built applications - you must be able to reproduce on the community app.
* Syntax errors with TVML
* "How do I..." questions
* Poorly written description of problem
* Inadequate reproduction steps
* Lack of TVML that reproduces the problem

Bugs must be reproducible with community app. If the only way to reproduce the bug is in your own custom built application then you must go through your app partner to report the bug.

If your bug is a simple visual bug that can be demonstrated with a screenshot then you must provide a screenshot showing the issue, even if it seems obvious. This must also be a full-device screenshot, this can not be cropped down. You must still provide the necessary TVML to reproduce the issue.

If your bug requires a series of steps (select this, then select this, then select this) then you _must_ make a video that demonstrates the problem and the steps involved. There are on-device screen recorders you can use or you can also just use a camera (or another phone) to record.

If the bug you are reporting is TVML related you must include the **entire** TVML required to reproduce - this means we should be able to copy and paste your TVML into new page and see the problem. If you give us just a tiny snippet of the TVML then your issue will be closed.

You must also provide a minimal reproduction example (read https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
